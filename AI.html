            <p style="font-size: large">This project arises from a passion I have gained in the past few years around understanding and working on AI NPC systems for games. During this time, I've better understood how systems like Finite State Machines, Behavior Trees, and others have evolved over the years and shaped the gaming industry. After some time, I decided that the best course of action as a programmer would be implementing some of the systems myself. The main plan was to spend some months designing and making an AI NPC system. Allowing me to understand better the process that AI/Gameplay programmers and designers would go through when working on the AI systems for a game.</p>
            <p style="font-size: large">The project's first stage was to create and work on a research and design document containing the research for the project and the plans for the AI NPC systems. The paper is organized into three main sections, the introduction, the main body of research, and how the current NPC system operates. The introduction contains a table of contexts, some introductory information about the project, and links to the supporting document alongside this principle document. The research section contains my research on navigation meshes, Finite State Machines (FSM), Behavior Trees, and Utility AI. As well as how these different systems have been implemented and evolved over the years in well-known games. The final section of the document contains an explanation of the FSM I would be implementing, mainly revolving around all the states that would be used and the tasks the state is meant to accomplish.</p>
