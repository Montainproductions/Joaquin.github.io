# About me

---

Hello, I am Joaquin De Losada, a 22 year old American-Peruvian. I am currently in my third year at Brock University studying in the Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both Github and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time. I originally was born in Maryland, U.S.A in November 2021 and because of my dads work I ended up moving around in the U.S for about 8 years until my family decided to move back to Peru so that we could be together with my extended family. After that I spent the rest of my school life in Peru studying and making a life there. During this time my dad started to present some old games including Age of Empires 2, Super Mario 64 and Myst while I also started playing a wider varaity of games allowing me to grow my passion for playing video games.

I continued playing video games and during middle school as part of a school project were I was given the oportunity to work on any project I wanted I decided I wanted to make a game as a way to see if this is something I would really be interested in making. After working on the game for about 5 months I found that the creation process was extreamly interesting and fun to do even when most of the time was spend trying to learn how to program and the basics of game design. Once I completed the game I continued playing games and learning how to program and make games to the point that when deciding what university and carrier I wanted to following high school. After applying to diffrent universities I decided to go to the IASC program at Brock university since this would allow me the versatility of being able to apply to diffrent feilds of work in the future while also allowing me to follow my passion of making video games.
