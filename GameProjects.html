                <p>Ever since I was in the 10th grade I found a passion for making video games and have over the years have made variouse games both alone and as part a group which has allowed me to learn a lot about the game creation process. I belive that this games best eximplefy how I am able to program and work in teams with other people to achive a goal.</p>

                <p class="smallertyped-text">AI learning project (In the works)</p>
                <p>For my 4th year of University at Brock I decided to take a course called "Directed project" which is meant to allow me to work on a project which would allow me to learn some new skill. SInce for a while I've been wanting to work more on AI systems for game I decided to create a basic game with diffrent AI systems allowing me to demonstrate my skills in designing and making AI.</p>
                <p>Before the class started I decided to do resarch on what are some common practices for AI creation is and how diffrent games implement said common practices into games. As I did resarch for the project and planning it out I created a design document where I have my reaserch and some of my design desicions that I have made before and during the project.</p>
                <p>As I started to work on the project I initially wanted to also attempt to learn how to work in Unreal Engine but after a couple of months working on the project I realized that I was spending more time learning and working on Unreal Engine instead of the AI systems. I decided to change to Unity since I have more experience working in Unity and would be able to work at an accelerated pace compared to working in Unreal.</p>
                <p>While working on the AI systems I implemented a Director AI for combat, and a cover system associated to the DIrector AI that I am very proud about and want to explain my thought process on when making the system. The intial problem I was trying to solve is how do I create difficulty in combat between the player and the enemy AIs while not overwhelming the player with all the enemies attacking the player at the same time. The way I solved this problem was by having each time an enemy detects the player</p>

                <p>During my third year of university I took a course which had my and a group of 14 other students would work together and use our experience to try and create a project. Working on a full year game allowed us to learn about some usefull techniques to both organize everyones times and keep everyone updated with progress on what everyone worked on. As the technical/unity lead for the project I had decided to organized the technical peoples jobs into a general jobs that would allow us to keep us somewhat organized was by giving certain people general roles that they could fufill. So we had one person mostly in charge of UI while another one might be encharge of replacing all current assets with the art teams assets. This meant that for the most part people would generally stay in their own areas of code which would reduce the chances that the same set of code might be affected. Though as we didnt have a lot of experience in making sure we had a standard programming practices in place for most of the project, we were small enough of a team that we could slowly learn how to better keep the code to a general standard that helped with redability.</p>
                <p>During the project we also decided to have weekly agail meetings where everyone talked about the things that they worked on for the past week. This allowed everyone to have a rough idea on the progress being made on diffrent components for the game and in turn even surface any problems that people might be having when they arent progressing through </p>

                <p>As part of a 4-month internship in Peru with a mining company in 2021, I worked on a prototype safety project which was meant to test out how possible it might be to make a full unity project that would be used to train and test workers on mine safty protocol. This project was made as part of a larger chain reserch on new training systems that the mining company was intreested in implementing and wanted to investigate the diffrent challenges that the diffrent systems might incurre.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project, I was able to quickly learn some of the best ways to appropriatly document all of the diffrent things I was working on so that anyone in the future could more easily understand what I was had been working on. In addition, as the mining company had a more corporate culture with people that might have a drastict level of techincal experience I had to learn quickly how to explain the typical process of making a project like this using a game engine and other similar systems.</p>
