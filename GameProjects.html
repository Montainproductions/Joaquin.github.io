                <p class="typed-text">Unity projects</p>
                <p>Ever since I was in the 10th grade, I found a passion for making video games and have, over the years, I have completed various games both alone and as part of a group, which has allowed me to learn a lot about the game creation process. These games best exemplify how I can program either alone or as part of a larger team with other people to achieve a goal common goal.</p>

                <p class="smallertyped-text">AI learning project (In the works)</p>
                <p>Throughout my time at Brock university, I became more interested in AI systems in games and how well-implemented AI allows the rest of the game features to shine even better. This meant that when I learned about a semester-long course that allowed me to work on any project, I wanted that would expand my skill set, I decided to take it and focus on designing and programming as interesting AI systems as possible.</p>
                <p>Before the class started, I decided to research standard AI systems over the years and how they were usually implemented in different games. As I studied for the project, I had initially planned on making a Finite State Machine (FSM) and behavior tree systems in Unreal Engine 5 to get as much experience as possible. But after a few weeks of trying to learn Unreal, I decided to use Unity instead and focus on making the AI system with an FSM. This would give me enough time to make sure that the AI was unique and give them enough different behaviors so that when people played against them, they would have a somewhat challenging opponent while also making them seem like they were thinking like "real people."</p>
                <p>While working on the AI systems, I realized I needed to implement a Director AI for combat to improve their decision-making and make them seem like they were making decisions like actual human beings. The main parts connected to the DIrector AI were the cover and attack states which would occur when an AI detected the player and needed to decide whether to attack or not. The initial problem I was trying to solve was how to create difficulty in combat between the player and the AIs while not overwhelming the player by having all enemies attack the player simultaneously. I decided to solve this by having each enemy that detects or is alerted of the player's nearby presence enter an "Aggression" state in which they would calculate a value based on specific information from its environment it knows about, with a higher value meaning that the AI is more willing to attack the player then go to cover. At this point, it will save the weight and request the Director AI to state that it would like to attack the player.</p>

                <p>During my third year of university I took a course which had my and a group of 14 other students would work together and use our experience to try and create a project. Working on a full year game allowed us to learn about some usefull techniques to both organize everyones times and keep everyone updated with progress on what everyone worked on. As the technical/unity lead for the project I had decided to organized the technical peoples jobs into a general jobs that would allow us to keep us somewhat organized was by giving certain people general roles that they could fufill. So we had one person mostly in charge of UI while another one might be encharge of replacing all current assets with the art teams assets. This meant that for the most part people would generally stay in their own areas of code which would reduce the chances that the same set of code might be affected. Though as we didnt have a lot of experience in making sure we had a standard programming practices in place for most of the project, we were small enough of a team that we could slowly learn how to better keep the code to a general standard that helped with redability.</p>
                <p>During the project we also decided to have weekly agail meetings where everyone talked about the things that they worked on for the past week. This allowed everyone to have a rough idea on the progress being made on diffrent components for the game and in turn even surface any problems that people might be having when they arent progressing through </p>

                <p>As part of a 4-month internship in Peru with a mining company in 2021, I worked on a prototype safety project which was meant to test out how possible it might be to make a full unity project that would be used to train and test workers on mine safty protocol. This project was made as part of a larger chain reserch on new training systems that the mining company was intreested in implementing and wanted to investigate the diffrent challenges that the diffrent systems might incurre.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project, I was able to quickly learn some of the best ways to appropriatly document all of the diffrent things I was working on so that anyone in the future could more easily understand what I was had been working on. In addition, as the mining company had a more corporate culture with people that might have a drastict level of techincal experience I had to learn quickly how to explain the typical process of making a project like this using a game engine and other similar systems.</p>
