                <p>Ever since I was in the 10th grade, I found a passion for making video games and have, over the years, I have completed various games both alone and as part of a group, which has allowed me to learn a lot about the game creation process. These games best exemplify how I can program either alone or as part of a larger team with other people to achieve a goal common goal.</p>

                <p>Recently I partook in the Ubisoft Next programming competition where I programmed a basic game based using C++ and a basic render provided by Unity. I competed in the Ubisoft next competition as a way to both test myself as well as attempt to learn C++ at the same time.</p>
                <p>As I worked on the project I was able to combine quick think on my feet with the use my Java and C# knowledge as well as searching for c++ specific knowledge to put together the project. By doing this I was able to make a basic game where the player would spawn into a 15X15 map with various green destructible boxes scattered around with red indestructible boxes serving as walls. The goal is that the player is attempting to control their fast drill to destroy as many of the green boxes as possible to increase their points before the timer runs out and then proceed to the next level. With every few levels the amount of time left for the player is reduced until they might not have enough time to complete a lot of the maze.</p>
                <p>Something I am proud about in the project is the level creation method as it is set up in a way that would allow it to create a new level each time the player goes to the next level or starts a new game. It is set up with a 2d array data type position which contains a x and y pixel position as well as a string with the object that is contained in the position. I proceed to go through the 2d array and place all of the walls that the player cant pass through both around the border and in the middle of the map itself. I proceed to determine if the current Position contains the string "Empty" to then return a number using a random method C++ has as part of their library and the current time as a seed to help with the randomness. If the number turns out to be less than 1/4 the max number that the seeded random can return (In this case is 32767) it will then set the Position as a breakable wall that the player can break to gain points and continue on with the level. Because of the chances that two people will start a new game or level at the same time it allows for the level creator the ability to seemingly create a new level each time.</p>
                <p>One way I could improve on the random number generator is by taking in account the current level, how many destructible walls have already been created in the level and the current position that the level created is looking at. This would allow for even more random levels as the chances that the combination of all these different variables can be achieved together would be difficult to achieve and allow for each new level someone plays to be unique to their playthrough.</p>

                <p class="smallertyped-text">AI learning project (In the works)</p>
                <p>Throughout my time at Brock university, I became more interested in AI systems in games and how well-implemented AI allows the rest of the game features to shine even better. This meant that when I learned about a semester-long course that allowed me to work on any project, I wanted that would expand my skill set, I decided to take it and focus on designing and programming as interesting AI systems as possible.</p>
                <p>Before the class started, I decided to research standard AI systems over the years and how they were usually implemented in different games. As I studied for the project, I had initially planned on making a Finite State Machine (FSM) and behavior tree systems in Unreal Engine 5 to get as much experience as possible. But after a few weeks of trying to learn Unreal, I decided to use Unity instead and focus on making the AI system with an FSM. This would give me enough time to make sure that the AI was unique and give them enough different behaviors so that when people played against them, they would have a somewhat challenging opponent while also making them seem like they were thinking like "real people."</p>
                <p>While working on the AI systems, I realized I needed to implement a Director AI for combat to improve their decision-making and make them seem like they were making decisions like actual human beings. The main parts connected to the DIrector AI were the cover and attack states that would occur when an AI detected the player and needed to decide whether to attack. The initial problem I was trying to solve was how to create difficulty in combat between the player and the AIs while not overwhelming the player by having all enemies attack the player simultaneously. I decided to solve this by having each enemy that detects or is alerted of the player's nearby presence enter an "Aggression" state in which they would calculate a value based on specific information from its environment it knows about, with a higher value meaning that the AI is more willing to attack the player then go to cover. At this point, it will save the weight and request the Director AI to state that it would like to attack the player.</p>

                <p>During my third year of university, I took a year-long course where 14 other students and I worked together to create a project. We decided to make a 2.5d simple dungeon game with the player trying to complete the 9th grade, which can be done by fighting enemies or answering questions related to typical class material people would learn during that school year. Working on a full-year game allowed us to learn valuable techniques to organize everyone's time and keep everyone updated with progress on what everyone worked on. During the project, I was in charge of the four people technical team, which allowed me to learn how to manage a small group and split tasks as best as possible depending on people skills. Initially, it wasn't straightforward in what areas people should work on as many of the group were learning how to work with Unity for the first time. However, since we planned on making a relatively simple game, we knew that the programmers with experience could efficiently work on the mechanics. At the same time, everyone else could spend time learning as much about working with Unity. So, after a while, we divided the tasks into UI, art implementation, and general programming and gave each job to someone. This allowed, for the most part, to have people only need to learn specific aspects of Unity without feeling overwhelmed knowing all of the different things of Unity. At the same time, it helped reduce the chances of merge conflicts occurring when pushing commits. Though because it was our first time working as a group, we only had little experience programming in similar styles, which meant that, at times, people needed to ask the other programmers how the code they had written was meant to do.</p>
                <p>During the project, we also decided to have weekly agile meetings where everyone discussed what everyone worked on for the past week and our plans for the following week. This allowed everyone to have a rough idea of the progress being made on the game over time. In addition, consistently talking about what we were working on allowed us to recognize specific problems as they were forming since if we noticed multiple people having the same trouble or if someone came with the same problem for various meetings, then we could work together to solve it before it becomes worse.</p>

                <p>As part of a 4-month internship I had done in Peru with a mining company called Consorsio Minero in 2021, I worked on a prototype safety project which was going to be used to determine the viability of creating a full-scale project to train and test people that were about to enter underground mines. I worked on the project in conjunction with other research on new training systems that the company was interested in implementing instead of using the typical PowerPoint presentation system.</p>
                <p>Throughout the project, I learned some of the best ways to appropriately document my work so that either future people or people currently at the company could more easily read through what I've worked on and how different sections relate. In addition, as I was working in a mining company, where there isn't as much experience working on similar technical projects like this one, I had to make sure that the people in charge of supervising the project were kept up to date with the progress while also explaining how the progression of similar projects tends to work.</p>
