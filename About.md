# About me

---

Hello, I am Joaquin De Losada, a 21 year old American-Peruvian. I am currently in my third year at Brock University studying in the Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both Github and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time. I originally was born in Maryland, U.S.A in November 2021 and because of my dads work I ended up moving around in the U.S for about 8 years until my family decided to move back to Peru so that we could be together with my extended family. After that I spent the rest of my school life in Peru studying and making a life there. During this time my dad started to present some old games including Age of Empires 2, Super Mario 64 and Myst while I also started playing a wider varaity of games allowing me to grow my passion for playing video games.


The games I find myself most repeatedly going back to play are Age of Empires 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Europa universal 4, and Minecraft.
