            <p class="typed-text">Java data structure class.</p>
            <p>As part of a computer science class I recently took, I learned how to work with different data structures and better break down problems and visualize problems to make better-designed programs.</p>
            <p>The data structure I had the most challenge in learning was heap arrays, and this was because, as it had been explained initially to me, I had understood that it had to be built similarly to a Binary tree. This meant that as I worked on the code, I consistently received either null pointers or incorrect values at different points of the code. After a while, I decided that the best solution was to go through the documentation and the books provided by the professor to understand how I was meant to implement a Heap Array properly. As I read through the different explanations, I also started using a whiteboard to work out how the arrays typically interact and how each step would affect some of the data I was implementing. Finally, after some time of whiteboarding the different interactions that an array would generally have, I could comprehend how I had to set up the array better so that it could start presenting the correct outputs.</p>
            <p>While working on the code, I also understood the problem of unsupervised time complexity, as I had sometimes added more steps and code than was necessary. This meant it would take over half a minute while the code was executing, which was drastically more prolonged than what I had understood the typical time for the program should take. But as I started to reduce the excess code and implement an improved heap array, I noticed it was running at an improved speed. So even though the assignment didn't ask for the program to take less than a given, I still wanted to ensure the code took little time. So in combination with the new working heap array, I made sure that some of the other sections of the code weren't taking up to much time running overall.</p>
