            <p class="typed-text">Java data structure class.</p>
            <p>As part of a computer science class I recently had taken I was able to learn how to work with diffrent data structures while also learning how to better breakdown problems and visualize problems to make better designed programs.</p>
            <p>The data structure I had the most challenge in learning was heap arrays, this was because when it had been initially explained to me I had understood that it had to be built similar to a Binary tree. This meant that as I worked on the code I consisntantly found myself either reciving null pointers or the incorrect values at diffrent point of the code. After a while I decided that the best solution was to go through the documentation and the books that had been provided by the professor to understand how I was meant to properly implement a Heap Array. As I read through the diffrent explanation I also started to use a whiteboard to work out how the arrays normally interact and how each step would affect some of the data that I was implementing. After some time of whiteboarding the diffrent interactions that an array would normally have I was able to comprehend how I had to better set up the array so that it could start presenting the correct outputs.</p>
