# Welcome to my website

Hello, I a am Joaquin De Losada a 21 year old American-Peruvian. I am currently in my third year at Brock University studing in the Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both Github and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time.

## Game Projects:

### Word Hunter
The first ever game that I made was called **Word Hunter** and I made it for a project in school as a way to see if game development and programming in general would be something I would be greatly interested in working on in my future. After watching variouse tutorials and working on the project while in school to make the game. It ended up being a top down game were the player has to find and collect all of the letters in each maze and once completing the maze and collecting the letters then you would have written a full word. I later realesed an upate the game in which I added a gaint maze were the player can take multiple routes to complete the maze and reach the end.

Released Date: February 2017

### Shooting Range
The second game I started working on shortly after releasing **Word Hunter** is called **Shooting Range**. The premis of the game is that the player is in a shooting range and you can buy diffrent weapons and use them to shoot randomly appearing wodden targets. As you destroy the targets you recive more money which can be used to buy the other weapons in the shooting range.

Released Date: December 2017
