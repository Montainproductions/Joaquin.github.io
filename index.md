# Welcome to my website

Hello, I am Joaquin De Losada, a 22-year-old American-Peruvian. I am currently in my third year at Brock University studying Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both Github and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time.

## Game Projects:

Ever since I was young I've always loved playing video games and when I had the opportunity to make anything I wanted I decided to make my own video game which is the maze hunter game and after that, I decided that programming and video games were a career that I wanted to pursue in the future. After that, I continued learning more about programming and testing more game ideas that I wanted to work on as a way to gain more experience. The next game I had created and released was a shooting range game where I wanted to practice more with an inventory system and moving between different rooms. After this point, I didn't try to release new games but instead try to learn and have a better understanding of programming and try different game ideas to see if any would be interesting enough to make a full game while also trying to finish high school. I didn't make another game until 2021 when I did an internship at a mining company where they wanted me to create a prototype game about mine safety protocols which was when I decided to learn how a typical game production workflow works so that in the future the company could have as much information they needed to continue the project when I am not part of the company anymore.

### AI Unreal project (In the works)

This project is a way for me to practice two improtant skills in my eyes as part of my preperation for my future career. For starters, over the past year I have become more invested in working with AI for video games and while look at my course load for my final year at Brock University I realized that I could take a Directed studies project class which allows me with the help of a professor work on a project that improves my skills. Which lead me to take the class through out the year (Normally only one semester) and create a basic shotter game which contains two diffrent types of AI, a Finite State Machine (FSM) and a behavior tree. Meanwhile I plan to make this game in Unreal Engine 5 as a way to test my ability to change systems and programming language (From mostly Unity and C# to Unreal and C++).

Important things I learned:

- Standard AI systems.

### Don't Fail the class Game

This project from a game that I had made in conjuntion other classmates from the IASC 3F02 class that I took in my third year of univeristy (2021-2022). The project we are working on is a 2.5d pixel art game in Unity where the player is trying to finish the 9th grade while fighting bullies, bosses, and challenges in the different classes. The game is planned to be a beta version of the game with only one school year as a way to see how fun and interesting a game with this option can be. At the same time, this allows me to learn how to better work collaboratively in a design/creative environment so that I am better prepared for when I start working in other industries as part of my work.

Important Things I learned:

- Communication inbetween disciplines when working on a project together.
- Better understanding of pre-production for a game.
- Learned how to create AI and how to make them more life like.

### Mining training game

This game is a project that I created during an internship at a mining company in Peru. The project along with the game was to see the feasibility of having a simulation of the companyâ€™s mine as a way to train the mine workers on different mine safety protocols. During the entire project, I made a basic GDD, and a beta version of the game so that upper management could see how a partially complete game would look and if it would be worth investing more money in actual developers to make a complete game.

Important things I learned:

- Creating a GDD
- First full game in Unity
- Keeping supervisor updated on progress
- Lighting in Unity

Release Date: September 2021

### Shooting Range

The second game I started working on shortly after releasing Word Hunter is called Shooting Range. The premise of the game is that the player is in a shooting range and you can buy different weapons and use them to shoot randomly appearing wooden targets. As you destroy the targets you receive more money which can be used to buy the other weapons in the shooting range. This game allowed me to learn how to create a basic inventory system to store and switch between the weapons.

Important things I learned:
- Saving info when changing room
- A switching inventory
- Random spawning

Release Date: December 2017

### Word Hunter

The first-ever game that I made was called Word Hunter and I made it for a project in school as a way to see if game development and programming, in general, would be something I would be greatly interested in working on in my future. After watching various tutorials and working on the project while in school to make the game. It ended up being a top-down game where the player has to find and collect all of the letters in each maze and once completing the maze and collecting the letters then you would have written a full word. I later released an update to the game in which I added a giant maze where the player can take multiple routes to complete the maze and reach the end.

Important things I learned:
- Basic script writing
- Importance of preplanning
- Basic level design

Release Date: February 2017
