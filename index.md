# Welcome to my website

Hello, I a am Joaquin De Losada a 21 year old American-Peruvian. I am currently in my third year at Brock University studing in the Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both Github and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time.

## Game Projects:

### Word Hunter
The first ever game that I made was called **Word Hunter** and I made it for a project in school as a way to see if game development and programming in general would be something I would be greatly interested in working on in my future. After watching variouse tutorials and working on the project while in school to make the game. It ended up being a top down game were the player has to find and collect all of the letters in each maze and once completing the maze and collecting the letters then you would have written a full word. I later realesed an upate the game in which I added a gaint maze were the player can take multiple routes to complete the maze and reach the end.

Important things I learnt:
- Basic script writing
- Importance of preplanning
- Basic level design

Release Date: February 2017

### Shooting Range
The second game I started working on shortly after releasing **Word Hunter** is called **Shooting Range**. The premis of the game is that the player is in a shooting range and you can buy diffrent weapons and use them to shoot randomly appearing wodden targets. As you destroy the targets you recive more money which can be used to buy the other weapons in the shooting range. This game allowed me to learn how to create a basic inventory system to store and switch between the weapons.

Important things I learnt:
- Saving info when changing room
- A switching inventory
- Random spawning

Release Date: December 2017

### Mining training game
This game is a project that I created during an internship at a mining company in Peru. The project along with the game was to see the feasibility of having a simulation of the companies mine as a way to train the mine workers on diffrent mine safity proticals. During the entire project I made a basic GDD, and an beta version of the game so that upper management could see how a partially complete game would look like and if it would be worth investing more money on actual developers to make a complete game.

Important things I learnt:
- Creating a GDD
- First full game in Unity
- Keeping supervisor updated on progress
- Lighting in Unity

Release Date: September 2021

## Repositories
I also have made diffrent repositories where I have uploaded diffrent projects I have or am currently working on as a way to show how I would solve diffrent problems.


### Dont Fail the class Game
This repository is for a group project that me and a some class mates from the IASC 3F02 class are creating. The project we are working on is a 2.5d pixel art game in unity were the player is trying to finish the 9th grade while fighting bullies, bosses and challenges in the diffrent classes. The game is planned to be a beta version of the game with only one school year as a way to see how fun and interesting a game with this option can be. At the same time this allows me to learn how to better work colaberativly in a design/creative envirnment so that I am better prepared for when I start working in other industrys as part of my work.

### Java Programming practice
I made this repository as a way to be able to continusly practice Java Programming. I got most of the challenges from Katties and slowly tried to get harder options as a way to continusly try to challange myself. I later started to work on a basic Java GUI system as a way to both practice how to make some basic GUI and to make an easier way to interact with all of the challenges that I complete in a more convininte manner instead of having to go through my code to try and find and run the specific challenge that I might of completed already.
