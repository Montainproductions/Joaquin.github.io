My main focus has been around being a software engineer for games and more specifically AI/NPC systems and how players are able to interact with them as well as other systems that are implemented in games. </div>

During this time, I've better understood how systems like Finite State Machines, Behavior Trees, and others have evolved over the years and shaped the gaming industry. After some time, I decided that the best course of action as a programmer would be implementing some of the systems myself. The main plan was to spend some months designing and making an AI NPC system. Allowing me to understand better the process that AI/Gameplay programmers and designers would go through when working on the AI systems for a game.</div>
