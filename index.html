            <p class="typed-text">Welcome to my page! A bit about me!</p>
            <p>Hello, I am Joaquin De Losada, a 23-year-old Peruvian. I am in my fourth year at Brock University studying Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both GitHub and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time.</p>

            <p>Below are some projects I've worked on over the years in unity that I've worked on in groups and alone as a solo dev. If you are interested in reading more about the projects, you can visit my Unity project page, where I go into deeper detail on what I've worked on in each project.</p>

            <p class="smallertyped-text">AI in games project (In progress)</p>
            <p>For this project, I initially wanted to learn how to implement my own AI systems into games and ways to make realistic AI. This led me to take a semester-long (4 months) course where I could work on an AI system and attempt to implement all the systems I had been learning until this point.</p>
            <p>Before starting, I decided to do as much research as possible on different ways that AI was being implemented in games and what were some important factors that I had to take into consideration. As I researched and started working on the finite state machine (FSM), I decided that I would only work on the FSM because it would allow me to make the best product possible.</p>

            <p>As part of my third year at Brock, I took a course that allowed me to work in a group to go through the entire production process for a project. For the project, our group decided to make a simple 2.5D game where you played as a student trying to finish their scheduled classes by fighting professors and students or solving puzzles.</p>

            <p>Release Date: September 2021</p>
            <p>As part of an internship in 2021 at a mining company in Peru, I made a prototype game to teach workers the basics of underground mine safety. During my time, I learned the different ways of presenting information to people of varying experience levels regarding what they knew about technical or game engine systems.</p>

            <p class="typed-text"><a href="ProgrammingRepo.html">Programming repository</a></p>
            <p> Besides the Unity projects, I've also worked on other programming challenges and placed them as repositories in Github to demonstrate. I decided to keep making sure I am learning new general programming features and to make sure specific, more common skills dont deteriorate over time.</p>
            <p class="smallertyped-text"> Java Programming Advanced data structure</p>
            <p>As part of a class I had taken at Brock University, I was able to work on and learn how to work with different data structures in Java. Throughout the assignments, I mostly worked on Double linked lists, Heaps, and similar data types. As a result, I learned distinctly about storing and manipulating data into arrays while understanding how memory and time complexity might affect a program when executed by the computer.</p>
