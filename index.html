            <p>Hello, I am Joaquin De Losada, a 23-year-old Peruvian. I am currently in my fourth year at Brock University studying Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). I made this website using markdown and Github pages as a way to bundle all of my projects from both GitHub and Itch.io together so that it is easier to find everything I have done and how I have improved over time.</p>

            <p>Below I have a list of games that I have worked on over the years which I am the most proud about. If interested in reading more about my games, you can visit my Game Project page where I explain in more detail all the diffrent games Ive worked on</p>

            <p class="smallertyped-text">AI in games project (In progress)</p>
            <p>For this game/project I wanted to learn how AI for games are normally implemented and then attempt to implement my own system as a way to show what I have learnt over the project.</p>
            <p>The first few months of the project I spent it doing reaserch learning about what what games use for AI and looking for tutorials that might be able to help me learn how to make a basic Finite State Machine (FSM) and a behaviour tree.</p>

            <p>As part of my third year at Brock I took a course that allowed me to work in a group to go through the entire production process for a project. For the project our group decided to make a simple 2.5D game where you played as a student who was trying to finish their schedualed classes by fighting professors and students or solving puzzles.</p>

            <p>Release Date: September 2021</p>
            <p>As part of an internship I had done in 2021 at a mining company in Peru in which I made a prototype game meant to teach workers on the basics of underground mine safty. During my time I was able to learn the diffrent ways of presenting information for people of diffrent experience levels when it came to what they knew about technical systems or game engine systems in general.</p>

            <p>As part of a class I had taken at Brock University I was able to work on and learn how to work with diffrent data structures in Java. Throughout the assignemnts I mostly worked on Linked lists, Heaps and then sorting said arrays.</p>
