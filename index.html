                                <div class="mainButtonText"> I designed and made a rudimentary Finite State Machine (FSM) in Unity during a 4-month timeline. The project was intended to learn and better understand the typical considerations of working around AI systems and their different limitations and possibilities when correctly done. This version of the FSM contains five (5) main states: Patrol, Idle, Aggression, Attack, and Cover, which the AI will transition to depending on whether it sees the player, proximity to said player vs the distance to cover points, and a few other internal reasons. I have enjoyed the process immensely, which has led me to continue working on the project and work on more complex projects revolving around AI systems for games.</div>
