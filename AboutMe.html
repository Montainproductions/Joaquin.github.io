                <p>Hello, I am Joaquin De Losada, a 23-year-old Peruvian. I am currently in my fourth year at Brock University studying Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). Even though I am currently in my final year of university, I have found myself enjoying being able of working on programming problems and even more when it comes to projects related to video games. Over the past year I have found that I have especially enjoyed designing and implementing AI systems for games as seen in my AI project that I have been working on.</p>
                <p>This website has been made as a way to have some of the projects I have worked over the years that I am the most proud about and that I belive best exemplify my ability to problem solve diffrent programming challenges. The website itself was made using HTML and CSS and is hosted on github pages and you can read the back end in my repositroy here: <a href="https://github.com/Montainproductions/Joaquin.github.io">Github Repository</a>.</p>
